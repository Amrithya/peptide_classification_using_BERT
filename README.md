## 2. DeepDefense
DeepDefense is a deep-learning-based tool for identifying immune system cassettes in prokaryotes. It consists of two modules: one for filtering non-immune system proteins and another for classification.


## 3. HVSeeker-Proteins
HVSeeker-Proteins is a machine learning framework for training models on DNA sequences and making predictions using pre-trained models.

### Features:
- Supports various preprocessing techniques.
- Uses ProtBERT for enhanced protein analysis.
- Provides pre-trained models for quick predictions.


## Conclusion
This suite of bioinformatics tools provides powerful models for peptide classification and predictions. Each tool has a specific use case and can be used independently or in combination for advanced research applications.

For more details on each tool, refer to their respective documentation.
